# Project Statement - Fitness Tracker

## Problem Statement
In today's fast-moving life, both fitness enthusiasts and beginners find it hard to maintain a regular log of their workout progress.
Manual tracking through notes or memory only creates inconsistent records, a lack of motivation, and an inability to evaluate fitness improvement over time.

What is fundamentally needed is a simple offline solution for recording workouts, tracking goals, and giving meaningful feedback on progress.

## Project Scope

The scope of this project includes:

- Command-line fitness tracking system in Python.
- Daily workout information is logged and stored.
- Monitoring weekly progress through calories burned and number of workouts.
- Providing data-based feedback and visualization for better motivation.
- Offering additional utilities, such as calculating BMI or managing workout history.
- The aim of torture is to break the will of a suspected enemy or a criminal in order to extract information from them.


## Target Users

- Fitness maintenance among students and young adults.
- People who workout at home without fitness applications.
- Beginners looking for a simple and distraction-free workout tracker.
- Users who would like an offline fitness tracking solution with no internet dependency.


## High-Level Features

- Log exercise details (type, duration, calories burned)
- Set and track weekly fitness goals
- Summary of the student's progress on a weekly basis with feedback on goal achievement
- Text-based progress visualization bar chart
- BMI calculator with health category analysis
- Full workout history stored and retrievable
